# Granada Web Presentation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Granada Web Presentation project! This project is dedicated to showcasing the beautiful city of Granada, Spain, through an interactive and responsive web experience. Our landing page is a simple project we had to manage to get in touch with responsive websites and a way through displaying items.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Our website is fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.
- **Rich Content**: The site features detailed sections on Granada's history, culture, landmarks, and more, presented in an engaging and informative manner.
- **Interactive Elements**: Users can interact with various elements for a more immersive experience.

## Visuals

We have carefully chosen visuals to complement the text, giving users a genuine feel of Granada's atmosphere. Please note:
- **Photo Resolution**: To manage space efficiently, we have decreased the resolution of the photos. They still retain good quality and are optimized for web use. It are just examples, just delete it and replace it with your desired path.
- **Video Background**: The landing page includes a placeholder for a video background. Due to space constraints, the actual `.mp4` file has been removed. Users can easily integrate their video by adding an `.mp4` file in the specified section of the code.

## Setup

To set up the video background, simply place your `.mp4` file in the appropriate directory and link it in the HTML file as follows:

```html
<video autoplay loop muted playsinline src="path-to-your-video.mp4" id="myVideo"></video>
```
